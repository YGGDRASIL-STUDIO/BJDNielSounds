**BJDNielSounds** is an sound collection created with BJD(Ball-Jointed Doll) **Niel**, a witch, session player and psychotherapist for GoldRock.

>_This is the story of **Niel**, a witch, who defeated **Gorgon** and protected the **Poet's Village**._
>
>_A long long time ago, a baby was born in the eyes of the storm. The baby was abandoned in a village from her parents, and the **Tracey**, the only one that she was believed he is a dad, he raised her with devotion. He named the her **Niel**._
>
>_However, because born with four arms, Niel was different from other childs. So Tracey made a lot of efforts to avoid being discriminated against. Fortunately, thanks to his efforts, Niel was a bright and happy child. The villagers also seemed to like her._
>
>_By the time she became a naughty girl, Tracey taught her astrology and flame magic spells, self-defense techniques, some instruments._
